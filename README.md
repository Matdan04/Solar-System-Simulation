# Solar-System-Simulation
This project is a visually engaging and interactive solar system simulation created using HTML and CSS.It provides a simple yet fascinating representation of the Sun, Earth, and the Moon in their celestial dance. The simulation includes the following features:
🌞The Sun is the central celestial body, radiating its characteristic yellow glow.
🌍The Earth orbits the 🌞Sun, offering a dynamic representation of the planet's journey through space.
🌙The Moon orbits the 🌍Earth, adding an additional layer of motion and realism to the simulation.
Each celestial body is represented with appropriate colors and dimensions.
Realistic shadow and highlight effects are used to create a sense of depth and dimension.
The project leverages CSS animations to mimic the orbit of the Earth and Moon around their respective central bodies.
